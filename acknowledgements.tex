I cannot thank enough all those who have supported me throughout the PhD. First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my advisor, Prof. Minje Kim, for drawing me out as a researcher, helping me grow my career, always being excited about music-related projects, and spoiling the lab with delicious food. Prof. Christopher Raphael introduced me to the field of music informatics, sharing his passion for the field from when he taught my first undergraduate computer science class. My interactions with Chris have taught me how to address complex and hard-to-define research problems. Prof. Daniel McDonald brought Kalman filters to life for me during a research rotation. Prof. Donald Williamson provided an essential perspective on deep learning as applied to audio and speech that has been very helpful.

My colleagues in the SAIGE lab and, more generally, in the Luddy School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering, were a constant source of friendship and research discussions. I would like to thank Sunwoo Kim for his endless curiosity; Aswin Sivaraman for helping me prepare figures in the early hours of the morning; Kai Zhen for his huge support in singing for my subjective tests; Haici Yang and David Badger---though we only overlapped for a year---for the insights they brought to the lab. Kahyun Choi provided inspiration for how to finish a thesis remotely and contributed to making my time at school fun. I would also like to thank Lijiang Guo for being a great cubicle neighbor, and Liang Chen, Yupeng Gu, Rong Jin, and Yucong Jiang for many interesting discussions about music. Thanks also to the many other faculty, students, and staff at Indiana University Bloomington, who provided inspiration for my work and made my studies enjoyable. In particular, I would like to thank Prof. David Crandall for serving on my qualifying committee, and Prof. Predrag Radivojac for teaching me crucial skills in machine learning. Finally, Prof. Paris Smaragdis from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign has been a terrific academic grandfather. 

My internships at Google, Smule, Amazon, and Spotify helped me advance both as a researcher and a software engineer, and provided new mentors and friends. I would like to thank Glenn Kasten, Andy Hung, John Shimmin, George Tzanetakis, Cheng-i Wang, Stefan Sullivan, Perry Cook, Shiva Sundaram, Aparna Khare, Sebastian Ewert, Keunwoo Choi, Simon Durand, and all my other teammates, for the wonderful opportunities I had to work with them. Thank you also to Tarun Pruthi and Trausti Kristjansson for their support as I completed my thesis while starting my first full-time job on the Amazon Lab126 audio team. 

I would also like to thank the many friends who made my time at Indiana University Bloomington very special and fun, and helped me make it through the challenges inherent to getting a PhD. Let me mention Minju Kim and her ideas for exciting road trips, and Ruth Osbrink who became a friend in undergrad. Ruth has been a constant source of adventures around town and an encouragement as I transitioned from music performance to music informatics. Warm thanks and gratitude to all the Bloomington friends for the companionship and support.

My familyâ€™s belief in me has been a big help in making it to the end of the degree. In particular, thank you to my parents for spoiling me with great food throughout my studies and being willing to listen to my complaints at any time. Thank you also to my brother Stefan and sister-in-law Julie for their helpful insights and for taking me on long hikes during the months when I was finalizing the thesis. Finally, I would like to thank the extended family for the wonderful support and encouragement that they have provided.
