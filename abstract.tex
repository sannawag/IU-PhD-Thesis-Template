User-generated audio recordings have become a common means of artistic expression. Smule, Spotify, Cadenza, YouTube, and Tik Tok are just a few examples of platforms that enable people to record and share their musical performance or podcast with friends or with a wider audience. In this thesis, I address the situation where a user does not record in a recording studio or use professional audio editing software. The user may wish to post-process the recording to improve room acoustics for better audio quality and intelligibility. They may also wish to adjust the musical intonation of their vocal performance. These two tasks share the requirement for the result to sound aesthetically pleasing and natural. A common challenge in automatic audio signal processing is avoiding robotic sounding or noisy artifacts. In this thesis, I explore the use of end-to-end deep-learning models for automatic pitch correction and dereverberation with natural sounding results. I combine convolutional and sequential layers in the proposed model architectures and use time- or time-frequency domain audio signals as inputs. When necessary, I use joint training or an adverserial loss to improve the quality of the results.
